# Introduction to Data Science Principles
> Part 1 of the PRGS DS+AI Sequence

### Prerequisites
- Math skills: Basic to Intermediate Calculus, Basic optimization concepts:
  -	Algebra, Derivatives, Integrals, basic multivariable Calculus, Lagrange Optimization.
-	Introductory Probability and Statistics (Stats 1): 
  - Probability distributions, statistical concepts (e.g. LLN/CLT/Confidence Intervals), 
  - basic Bayesian inference, estimation concepts (MLE)
-	Basic Statistical Modelling (Stat 2)
  - Basic regressions (linear + logit)
  - PRGS `Stats 3` course


## Course Details
This 5-week course will introduce students to foundational concepts in data science (DS) practice, building on their prior exposure to probability and statistical concepts. The class will focus on the theoretical underpinnings of data science practice with an aim to enable students to: 
1. confidently understand and apply the methods; 
2. recognize the relevant assumptions and limitations; 
3. understand the similarities and differences between DS and standard statistical practice (where those differences exist).

The end-state for students in this course is a clear understanding of the rationale and mechanics of DS practice.
